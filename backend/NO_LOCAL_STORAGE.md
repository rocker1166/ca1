# No Local Storage Implementation

## Changes Made

This implementation removes all local storage of PPTX files and relies solely on GoFile.io for file storage.

### Key Changes:

1. **PPTBuilder Class (`services/ppt_builder.py`)**:
   - `build()` method now returns `BytesIO` instead of file path
   - Removed `OUTPUT_DIR` and local file saving
   - PPTX is created in memory only

2. **GoFile Service (`services/gofile_service.py`)**:
   - Added `upload_stream()` method to handle BytesIO uploads
   - Supports direct stream upload without temporary files

3. **API Routes (`api/routes.py`)**:
   - Removed `/download/{filename}` endpoint
   - Both sync and async processing now upload directly to GoFile
   - Response no longer includes local `url` field
   - Only `online_url` is provided in responses
   - GoFile upload failure now returns HTTP 500 error

4. **Removed Utilities**:
   - No longer uses `utils/file_manager.py` for cleanup
   - No local file cleanup needed

### API Response Changes:

**Before:**
```json
{
  "url": "/download/abc123.pptx",
  "online_url": "https://gofile.io/d/xyz789",
  "slides": ["Title", "Content"],
  "username": "user",
  "topic": "topic"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "online_url": "https://gofile.io/d/xyz789",
  "slides": ["Title", "Content"],
  "username": "user", 
  "topic": "topic"
}
```

### Requirements:

- GoFile integration **must** be enabled (`GOFILE_ENABLED=true`)
- Valid GoFile API token required
- If GoFile upload fails, the request returns HTTP 500 error

### Benefits:

- No local disk storage required
- No cleanup processes needed
- Reduced server storage requirements
- All files stored in centralized cloud location
- Eliminates local file management complexity

### Testing:

Run the test script to verify implementation:
```bash
python test_no_local_storage.py
```

This will verify:
1. No local PPTX files are created
2. Local download endpoint is removed
3. Only online URLs are returned
